# Data
The `brvehins` dataset with 2.6M records of insurance policies and claims from Brazil in 2011 was reproduced from the `CASdatasets` package developed for R and hosted on GitHub at [this link](https://github.com/dutangc/CASdatasets). You can find more documentation on the origin of this data [here](https://www2.susep.gov.br/menuestatistica/Autoseg/principal.aspx). The file `data/brvehins/brvehins_raw.parquet` is a copy of the four RData files from the `brvehins2` dataset listed on the linked Git repository.
